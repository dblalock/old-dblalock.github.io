I'm a machine learning PhD student at MIT. I make fast unsupervised/semi-supervised learning algorithms.

Here's the official version:

"Davis Blalock is a PhD student at MIT, advised by Professor [John Guttag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Guttag). His primary work is designing high-performance machine learning algorithms, with the goal of turning streams of medical, smart phone, and wearable sensor data into useful pictures of peopleâ€™s health. He received his M.S. from MIT in 2016 and his B.S. from the University of Virginia in 2014. He is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, Qualcomm Innovation Fellow Finalist, and Barry M. Goldwater Scholar."
