*This post is based on the classic [Good Project Manager, Bad Project Manager](https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/).* <!--  "[UROP](http://uaap.mit.edu/research-exploration/urop)" is MIT's word for undergraduate researchers, which I use as a convenient abbreviation even though these ideas are not specific to MIT* -->

| Bad Undergrad | Good Undergrad |
|:----|:----|
|Doesn't care about the project and just wants a line on their resume           | Believes strongly in the value of the project and wants to work on it |
| When encountering an unforeseen obstacle, does nothing                        | When encountering an unforeseen obstacle, figures out a way around it, or makes as much progress as possible with it there |
| When unsure what to do, does nothing. | When unsure what to do, asks for clarification or defines specific tasks consistent with their overall goal |
| Blindly accomplishes tasks without trying to understand the goals of the project | Understands the goal of the project they're working on and uses this to navigate uncertainty and learn about the research process |
|Gives up when they don't know how to do something                              | Learns what they need to accomplish their tasks |
| Asks their mentor whenever they encounter a problem, or doesn't ask for help when a quick email response could save them hours | First tries to solve problems on their own and identifies when it's worth others' time to help them |
| Needs their mentor to figure out the details of what they're doing            | Takes ownership of their piece of the project and figures out the details on their own |
| Is unpleasant to interact with                                                | Is always pleasant to interact with |
| Does nothing as soon as classes get busy                                      | Always makes progress except in one or two extremely busy weeks |
| Learns the minimum necessary to do their job, or less                         | Is constantly learning and is on par with the grad students by the time they're a senior |
| Doesn't ask questions because they're afraid of looking ignorant              | Knows that they aren't expected to know anything at first and get evaluated mostly on their accomplishments and initiative |
| Treats research like a personal side project that can always be neglected     |  Treats research like a part time job demanding serious commitment |
| Works on research sporadically throughout the week                            | Blocks off dedicated time for research |
| Sits down to "work" without a clear plan or goals                             |  Defines goals for the week and identifies an efficient and concrete path to hitting them |
| Never gets to know the research group                                         | Sometimes comes to meetings or works in lab and feels like a lab member after a few months |
| Does the minimum necessary                                                    | Shows enthusiasm and initiative, often doing more than what's expected |
| Doesn't track, or even remember, what they've done                            | Keeps a written list of what they've accomplished so it's easy to write a recommendation for them |
| Writes unprofessional, casual emails                                          | Writes professional emails that are as concise as possible, grammatically correct, and use appropriate titles for professors ("Hello Professor Smith", not "Hi John"). |
| Is often late, and doesn't tell their mentor when they're going to be late or absent | Is rarely late, and makes absences known days in advance |
| Doesn't take notes on what they're supposed to do or what experimental results they've gotten         | Keeps a meticulous lab notebook |
| Writes terrible code no one can use but them                                  | Writes terrible code for their own experiments no one will look at, but builds well-documented software with a clean API for tools that others will use. |
| Only uses tools they already know or are forced to learn                      | Learns to use the best tools for the job---e.g., manipulating data with Pandas instead of nested Python lists. |

## Summary

A good undergrad researcher is *tenacious*. They're excited about what they're doing, take ownership of their piece of the project, and get stuff ***done***. They get up to speed on the project quickly, figure out the details themselves, and find a way through obstacles and uncertainty. They're organized, professional, easy to work with, and constantly improving. They eventually make creative contributions to their projects and become like another grad student.

A bad undergraduate researcher doesn't care about what they're working on, assigns low priority to research, and does the bare minimum that's asked of them (or less). They always have an excuse to not get work done and can't be relied upon.
