When I was in high school, I hated statistics. It was a bunch of meaningless formulas you had to memorize and magical numbers you had to look up in tables to test for the almighty "statistical significance."

Turns out, however, that a lot of statistics makes perfect sense, and no one ever tells you. In fact, it's basic geometry.

To get there, we need to unlearn some bad ideas about vectors. If you remember college physics, you probably remember vectors as arrows in 2D or 3D space.

That's a decent way to look at it for physics, but it's limiting.
